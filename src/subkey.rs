//! Subkey handle.
//!
//! In librnp a subkey is just a `rnp_key_handle_t` with `is_sub() == true` —
//! every getter that works on a primary key also works on a subkey.
//! [`Subkey`] is therefore a thin newtype over [`Key`](crate::Key): it
//! forwards via Deref so callers don't have to learn a parallel surface.
